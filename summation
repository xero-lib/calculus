Sigma, Σ

      m
      Σ
     i=1
    
m = the number the function will stop at when reached 
i = the intiger at which the function will start, and will always increment by a factor of exactly 1

For example:

       5
       Σ   = 2+3+4+5+
      i=2 
The output of this function would be 14 (2+3+4+5), because we start at 2 and increment by one until we reach 5
